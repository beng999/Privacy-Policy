For the purposes of a university project from the Vienna University of Economics (WU Vienna), in the course ‘5597 Data Processing 2: Scalable Data Processing, Legal & Ethical Foundations of Data Science’, we will collect information about the content of the Subreddit r/wallstreetbets, to practice dealing with the scalable handling of big data.

Only information regarding the content of the post and the date will be collected.

The content of the posts will be analyzed via Machine Learning techniques and used to predict stock index scores using the sentiment analysis tool Vader.

The data will be stored on the students´ personal computers and the servers hosted by the WU Vienna, as the results will be submitted to the university.

The project is for educational purposes only. Therefore, the collected data will not be used for business purposes.
